          What began as an exercise to ease cognitive disonance,
          somehow took on a life of its own, becoming an earnest
          attempt to shed light on <em>Waiting</em> as a Mode of Being.

          <h2>Easier Said Than Sung</h2>

          <p>
            As a sound engineer with serious difficulties keeping my opinions to myself,
            I needed to establish some authority on the basis of which to justify shoving my opinions
            into the faces of actual recording artists. <br><br>
            <!--
            "Let's run another take, but with a bit more <em>energy</em> this time. <br>
            Does that make sense? Of course it does. Great. <br>
            Okay, Rolling." <br><br>
            For some reason, that next take still lacked the precision and clarity that it needed. <br>
            And the next take. The clock ticks, the meter runs, frustration surfaces. <br><br>
            But what can I do? It's not my fault if you can't perform your track the way it sounds in your head. <br>
            I'm just here to record what you give me. <br>
            Sure. All sorts of analog and digital <em>processing</em> can be applied to the recording after the fact, but this will
            introduce unexpected <em>color</em> and a result that just isn't the same as an outright inspired performace. <br><br>
            Halfway through the session, we are still missing those crucial three decibels around four kilohertz. <br>
            But how the hell do you tease those three decibels out of an artist without turning their session into an episode of <em>Bill Nye the Science Guy?</em> <br>
            Maybe this time I'll tell them to do it with more <em>Atitude.</em> <br><br>
            This could only go on so long. <br>
            As fulfilling as it was, claiming status and power on the basis of some shiny gear, it was time for a reality sandwich. <br>
            Telling someone again and again that they could be doing something better-without being able to demonstrate how or why-gets old. <br>
            -->
            I decided the only thing for it was to step out of my comfort zone. <br>
            I needed to climb down from my pulpit at the console and get in front of a microphone.
            I needed experience.<br><br>
            But the first thing I experienced in front of the mic was speechlessness. <br>
            Was I cured of my inability to shut up already? <br><br>
            Unfortunately (for anyone still willing to work with me) I didn't give up so easily. <br>
            But I did have to concede that coming up with something worth recording is a daunting task in itself.

            I turned to a three-year-old field recording that I found on an old hard drive. <br>
            It was accompanied by a note in which my younger self vowed to claim poetic revenge. <br>
            The audio file was a recording of one of those traffic lights, tricked out with audio <br>
            to assist blind people &mdash; though I'm certain that
            this one mostly saved clueless students, drifting towards the curb with their faces glued to some screen. <br><br>
            "Wait... Wait... Wait..." <br><br>
            To the more alert pedestrians, it was annoying. <br>
            To a nerd like me, it was poetry.<br><br>
            Without question, my poet had a limited arsenal of literary devices and an even worse vocabulary. <br>
            But I couldn't deny that his careful diction and subtle mastery of repitition fit the meaning of his piece. <br>
            What struck me most of all, was the masked suggestiveness: I was stuck in the Mode of Being of Waiting. <br>
            Maybe a lot of us were. <br>
            Quite the critique from a traffic light!

            I probably really began to appreciate it around midterms. <br>
            A time when you're forced to question the loyalty of your own two feet. <br><br>
            "You can turn around," I remind myself. <br>
            "You are a grown-ass man and can walk straight out of here." <br><br>
            "Wait," suggests the light. <br><br>
            The traitors comply. So that's how it's going to be.

            Three years later the opportunity presents itself. <br>
            No more waiting. Time for some good old fashioned poetic justice. <br>
            As he twisted my feet aginst my will I will twist his words in my music. <br><br>
            Now I had something to record and if I did it right, <br>
            I might just escape that poem's cruel circling.

            How or when it happened, I haven't the foggiest idea. <br>
            I thought I had left it far enough in the past. <br>
            Apparently that is no way to think about it. <br>
            Though my feet, still ashamed, managed to resist his commanding tone this time around, my hand faltered. <br>
          <!--
            I scraped together the lyrics of the first track from some notes I had scrawled down my second week at school. <br>
            At the time, they seemed to fit the tone, so I went with it. <br>
            In hindsight, probably not my best strategic move. <br>
            I listened to that first track again and again until I thought I knew what had to come next. <br><br>
          -->
            The project seemed to write itself. <br>
            I convinced myself that this was creativity or inspiration or something. <br>
          <!--
            If it can be called anything like that, it was more like a Haunting In Connecticut style demon-posession. <br>
          -->
            Before my eyes,
            the calculated, spite-born plot to transcend that poem forever melted instead into a <em>thesis</em> on its central theme. <br><br>
            It became a phenomenology of Waiting.

          Strangely, few people seemed to share my fascination with <em>Waiting</em> as a <em>Mode of Being.</em> <br>
          So the project had to complete itself with a small team. <br><br>
          Of course, I am still indebted to the people whose ideas I stole to make it happen. <br><br>
          Likewise, if it weren't for the mentors, friends and family who have always waited for me, <br>
          I'd still be waiting for my chance to finally make my music.
